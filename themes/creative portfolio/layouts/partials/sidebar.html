Starting from a similar average activity in all sectors, we can see the peaks prior to confinement in food (where the population was supplied by these -especially toilet paper as reported in the media-) and the beginning of the down in the rest of the activities. Weekend peaks are also observed, especially in ‘Social’. 
Then there is the drastic decline in all activities with the imposition of the first confinement, with the most affected sectors being reservations for restaurants and and ‘social’, and a less drastic change for food and pharmacy products. It is also observed that while during the confinement the most affected sectors remain stationary with very low activity, as the confinement progresses if trade in general, both food and recreational, is recovering, remaining with a significantly higher activity. elevated food and basic necessities.
With the lifting of the first confinement, all sectors are exploring a linear recovery during the summer, but without having recovered the activity of pre-pandemic 'normality', if several points -outliers- are observed, probably due to the holiday periods and back to work. Grocery stores are ahead of the rest of the sector.
Given the restrictions applied with the second September wave, the two most punished sectors 'social' and 'restaurant reservations' return to low levels of confinement, and trade and recreation also fall, while grocery and pharmacist products experience in this case any downfall.
